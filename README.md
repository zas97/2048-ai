AI that uses monte carlo tree search to play 2048, it arrives consistenetly to the 4096 tile.

I only created the AI that makes decides the move to make, the rest of the code was forked from nneonneo.

## Building

### Unix/Linux/OS X

Execute

    ./configure
    make

in a terminal. Any relatively recent C++ compiler should be able to build the output.

Note that you don't do `make install`; this program is meant to be run from this directory.

### Windows

You have a few options, depending on what you have installed.

- Pure Cygwin: follow the Unix/Linux/OS X instructions above. The resulting DLL can *only* be used with Cygwin programs, so
to run the browser control version, you must use the Cygwin Python (not the python.org Python). For step-by-step instructions, courtesy Tamas Szell (@matukaa), see [this document](https://github.com/nneonneo/2048-ai/wiki/CygwinStepByStep.pdf).
- Cygwin with MinGW: run

        CXX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ CXXFLAGS='-static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc -D_WINDLL -D_GNU_SOURCE=1' ./configure ; make

    in a MinGW or Cygwin shell to build. The resultant DLL can be used with non-Cygwin programs.
- Visual Studio: open a Visual Studio command prompt, `cd` to the 2048-ai directory, and run `make-msvc.bat`.

## Running the command-line version

Run `bin/2048` if you want to see the AI by itself in action.

## Running the browser-control version

### Firefox

Enable Firefox remote debugging by setting the about:config options "devtools.debugger.remote-enabled" and "devtools.chrome.enabled" to true, then start Firefox with the `--start-debugger-server 32000` command-line option.

Open up the [2048 game](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) or any compatible clone and start remote control.

Run `2048.py -b firefox` and watch the game! The `-p` option can be used to set the port to connect to.

### Chrome

Enable Chrome remote debugging by starting it with the `remote-debugging-port` command-line switch (e.g. `google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222`).

Open up the [2048 game](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), then run `2048.py -b chrome` and watch the game! The `-p` option can be used to set the port to connect to.
